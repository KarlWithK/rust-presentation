# What you can use Rust for:
  - Writing system software
  - Rust can be used for creating web projects (ie. Dropbox, OpenDNS, Coursera, Discord)
  - Blockchain because of it's ability to quickly process requests.
  - Because it is high performance, games.
  - In the future using Rust for machine learning looks good, because of its low-level memory control and performance.

# Why you shouldn't use Rust
  - Compiler is very slow.
  - Language is difficult for people coming from other languages.
  - Memory leakage (?)
  - Code is a lot harder to develop than on c or c++

  - No garbage collector
