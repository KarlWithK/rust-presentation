# History of Rust
  - Rust was a personal project that began in 2006 by Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare.
  - C++ was difficult to write in
  - Rust was intended to be a language for highly concurrent and safe systems.
  - The first prealpha release of Rust occurred in Janurary 2012.
  - Hoare stopped working on the project in 2012 due to burnout.
  - Rust 1.0 was released on May 15, 2015.

# What is Rust?
  - Systems language
  - Statically-type multi paradigm (functional, OOP, imperative etc.)
  - Stack Overflow's most loved language
  - Focus on Performance, Reliability, and Productivity -> Memory
  - SAFE

# Terms to know

| Word              | Definition                                                             |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pointer           | Variable that stores the address of another variable                   |
| Free              | Function that clears memory allocated to a variable                    |
| Garbage Collector | A feature in PLs that automatically frees memory not needed in Runtime |
| &                 | Operation to view a memory address of a variable                       |

# Memory Safety
  - A language that can check for errors before runtime
  - Almost no safer operations
  - Ownership (slices, pointers, borrowing)
  
---

# Features
  - Compiler Messages
  - Great libraries
  - Toolchain
  
---

# What you can use Rust for:
  - Writing system software
  - Web projects (ie. Dropbox, OpenDNS, Coursera, Discord)
  - Games (high performance)
  - Machine learning (low-level memory control and performance)

---

# Why you shouldn't use Rust
  - Compiler is very slow due to many features
  - Language is difficult for people coming from other languages
  - Code is a lot harder to develop than on c or c++
  - No garbage collector, which isn't for everyone
